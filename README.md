## 1. [Congress](https://github.com/franciscogaluppo/Minor-Projects/blob/master/Congress.ipynb)
Each brazilian state has a number of seats in the House of Representatives proportional to its population. But there's a caveat: there is a minimum and a maximum of seats a single state can hold. We can use Mixed Integer Programming to compare the true proportional allocation of seats with the one used by the congress.
